# Provider Pattern

Easily Implemented With React's New [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

It solves the problem of prop drilling

---

### Usage
Create Provider, Consumer pair

```jsx
const { Provider, Consumer } = React.createContext(defaultValue);
```
Use provider to provide some value
```jsx
<Provider value={/* some value */}>
    {children}
</Provider>
```
---

Consume value using a Consumer
```jsx
<Consumer>
  {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
</Consumer>
```

# Caveats

- Unnecessary rerenders when a providers parent rerenders. 
> Can be solved by putting context on state or an instance method
