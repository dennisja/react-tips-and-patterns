## [Beyond Render Props](https://codesandbox.io/s/pj3vx52qoj)
### Inversion of Control
- **Prop Collections:**
Can be used with render props to pass props that are common to all elements that will be rendered by the render prop

---

- **Prop Getters:**
 Do other actions after predefined methods in your component

 - **State Initilizers:**
 Break Encapsulation:  by Giving you component users a way to initialize their state

---

 - **State Reducers:**
 Give Users a way to modify how your component state is managed

- **Control Props:**
 Control how components behave by passing in control props to elements.
 The props are controlled by the parent element

 ```notes
  The terms “controlled” and “uncontrolled” usually refer to form inputs, but they can also describe where any component’s data lives.
  Data passed in as props can be thought of as controlled
  (because the parent component controls that data).
  Data that exists only in internal state can be thought of as uncontrolled
  (because the parent can’t directly change it).
