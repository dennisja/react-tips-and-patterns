## Presentation and Container Components
*Also known as Fat & Skinny, Smart & Dumb, Stateful & Pure, Screens & Components e.t.c*

---

|Presentation | Container|
-------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------
Concerned with how things look                    | Concerned with how things work
No dependencies on rest of application e.g stores | Call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational components.
Allow containment via `this.props.children`       | Provide data and behaviour to Presentation
Rarely have their own state or some have UI state | Stateful as they tend to serve as data sources
Are functional components unless they need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations | Usually generated by HOC e.g connect from React Redux

---
## Benefits
- Better separation of concerns i.e data fetching and rendering
- Better reusability. Presentational components can be used in different places
- Self documenting i.e Presentation components define the data they expect

```jsx
//  Intstead of
 class CommentList extends React.Component {
  this.state = { comments: [] };

  componentDidMount() {
    fetchSomeComments(comments =>
      this.setState({ comments: comments }));
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <ul>
        {this.state.comments.map(c => (
          <li>{c.body}—{c.author}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    );
  }
}
```

---
```jsx
// Do this
class CommentListContainer extends React.Component {
  state = { comments: [] };
  componentDidMount() {
    fetchSomeComments(comments =>
      this.setState({ comments: comments }));
  }
  render() {
    return <CommentList comments={this.state.comments} />;
  }
}

const CommentList = props =>
  <ul>
    {props.comments.map(c => (
      <li>{c.body}—{c.author}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
```
