# Disclaimer

Content Discussed Here might not be the **BEST PRACTICES**

But they are **GOOD PRACTICES**

Which might turn out to be **BEST PRACTICES** in **SOME SCENARIOS**

---
## [Defining React component APIS](http://jxnblk.com/writing/posts/defining-component-apis-in-react/)

  ## 1. Aim for a small API surface area (React as a metaphor)

  The easier the api, the easier to reuse and avoid duplications. 

---
## 2. Make things easy to find

Don‚Äôt start with a complex folder structure. 
Start flat and refactor as you grow. 
Adopt [colocation](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html) as you grow i.e keep files that change together close.

[@danabramov](https://github.com/gaearon) on the best [folder structure](https://react-file-structure.surge.sh/)

---
## 3. Avoid renderThing methods 
It sometimes means there is enough complexity to be worth breaking down

---

export default Layout

```jsx
// Instead of this
class Items extends React.Component {
  renderItems ({ items }) {
    return items.map(item => (
      <li key={item.id}>
        {this.renderItem(item)}
      </li>
    ))
  }

  renderItem (item) {
    return (
      <div>
        {item.name}
      </div>
    )
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <ul>
        {this.renderItems(this.props)}
      </ul>
    )
  }
}
```
---

```jsx
// Do this
const ItemList = ({ items }) =>
  <ul>
    {items.map(item => (
      <li key={item.id}>
        <Item {...item} />
      </li>
    )}
  </ul>

const Item = ({ name }) =>
  <div>{item.name}</div>

class Items extends React.Component {
  render () {
    const { items } = this.props
    return <ItemList items={items} />
  }
}
```

---
## 4. Split components at data boundaries
Often, components should be defined by the shape of your data. Avoid using bootstrap components if possible.

```notes
Adopt the [Rule of Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)) 
when refactoring i.e if you have duplicated a component structure three times in your code base consider refactoring
```

---
## 5. Avoid [Apropcalypse](https://speakerdeck.com/jenncreighton/flexible-architecture-for-react-components?slide=10)
Don‚Äôt be afraid to create a new component rather than adding abritrary props and additional logic to a component

---

```jsx
// Instead of this ‚ùå
<Button
  variant='secondary'
  size='large'
  outline
  label='Buy Now'
  icon='shoppingBag'
  onClick={handleClick}
/>

// Do this üëç
<SecondaryButton
  size='large'
  onClick={handleClick}>
  <Icon name='shoppingBag' />
  Buy Now 
</SecondaryButton>
```
```notes
Your needs may vary, but reducing the number of custom props 
that any component requires is generally helpful, 
and reducing the amount of logic in the render function 
can make the code base simpler and better-suited for code splitting.
```

---
## 6. Use Composition
Don‚Äôt reinvent `props.children`. If you‚Äôve defined props that take arbitrary
 strings of text that aren‚Äôt based on a data structure, 
 it‚Äôs probably better to use composition.

---

```jsx
// Instead of this
<Header
  title='Hello'
  subhead='This is a header'
  text='And it has arbitrary props'
/>

// Do this
<Header>
  <Heading>Hello</Heading>
  <Subhead>This is a header</Subhead>
  <Text>And it uses composition</Text>
</Header>
```

---
## 7. Avoid Boolean Props for enums
They bring about confusion when dealing with variants

---

```jsx
// instead of 
<Button primary />
<Button secondary />

// think about what happens if a user does this
<Button primary secondary/>

// this is better
<Button variant="primary" />
```

---
## 8. Keep props APIs parallel
Reuse props from other components i.e if you‚Äôre creating a custom text input, 
use the same props as the native 

```<input type='text' />``` expects
---
## 9. Ask Your Team Mates
 If these don't fit in your use case then :-
  - Try talking to your teammates
  - Create RFCs, issues and PRs
  - Try [Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html).

# Reflection
** Writing React components is easy.**

** Creating a library of components that works well for your team is worth the time and effort to get right.**
