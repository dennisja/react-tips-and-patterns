# Render Props
A render prop is a function prop that a component uses to know what to render.

This enables sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.

It helps in sharing the state or behavior that one component encapsulates to other components that need that same state.

## Advantages
- No naming collisions
- Can be implemented using both ES6 classes and functions
- Normal React - Its `jsxy`

---
## Caveats

- [A render prop can negate the advantage that comes from using React.PureComponent](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html#be-careful-when-using-render-props-with-reactpurecomponent)

```notes
If you create the function inside a render method the shallow prop comparison will always return false for new props,
and each render in this case will generate a new value for the render prop.
```

## Solutions
- Make the render prop an instance method to store it by reference
