# Why React Apps Might be Slow?
Browser
    - Dom elements and mutations
    - Repaints and Reflow
    - Garbage Collection

2. React
    - Unnecessary Re renders
    - React Development Build(Bundle Size)

## Error Boundaries
 JavaScript error in a part of the UI shouldn‚Äôt break the whole app. 

Error boundaries do 
 - catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, 
 - log those errors
 - display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. 

---

Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them.
Error boundaries do not catch errors for:
 - Event handlers (learn more)
 - Asynchronous code (e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks)
 - Server side rendering
 - Errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children)

Note: Event handling doesn‚Äôt happen during rendering. Hence catch errors in event handlers using try/catch
