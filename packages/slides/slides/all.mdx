# Disclaimer

Content Discussed Here might not be the **BEST PRACTICES**

But they are **GOOD PRACTICES**

Which might turn out to be **BEST PRACTICES** in **SOME SCENARIOS**

---
## [Defining React component APIS](http://jxnblk.com/writing/posts/defining-component-apis-in-react/)

  ## 1. Aim for a small API surface area (React as a metaphor)

  The easier the api, the easier to reuse and avoid duplications. 

---
## 2. Make things easy to find

Don‚Äôt start with a complex folder structure. 
Start flat and refactor as you grow. 
Adopt [colocation](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html) as you grow i.e keep files that change together close.

[@danabramov](https://github.com/gaearon) on the best [folder structure](https://react-file-structure.surge.sh/)

---
## 3. Avoid renderThing methods 
It sometimes means there is enough complexity to be worth breaking down

---

export default Layout

```jsx
// Instead of this
class Items extends React.Component {
  renderItems ({ items }) {
    return items.map(item => (
      <li key={item.id}>
        {this.renderItem(item)}
      </li>
    ))
  }

  renderItem (item) {
    return (
      <div>
        {item.name}
      </div>
    )
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <ul>
        {this.renderItems(this.props)}
      </ul>
    )
  }
}
```
---

```jsx
// Do this
const ItemList = ({ items }) =>
  <ul>
    {items.map(item => (
      <li key={item.id}>
        <Item {...item} />
      </li>
    )}
  </ul>

const Item = ({ name }) =>
  <div>{item.name}</div>

class Items extends React.Component {
  render () {
    const { items } = this.props
    return <ItemList items={items} />
  }
}
```

---
## 4. Split components at data boundaries
Often, components should be defined by the shape of your data. Avoid using bootstrap components if possible.

```notes
Adopt the [Rule of Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)) 
when refactoring i.e if you have duplicated a component structure three times in your code base consider refactoring
```

---
## 5. Avoid [Apropcalypse](https://speakerdeck.com/jenncreighton/flexible-architecture-for-react-components?slide=10)
Don‚Äôt be afraid to create a new component rather than adding abritrary props and additional logic to a component

---

```jsx
// Instead of this ‚ùå
<Button
  variant='secondary'
  size='large'
  outline
  label='Buy Now'
  icon='shoppingBag'
  onClick={handleClick}
/>

// Do this üëç
<SecondaryButton
  size='large'
  onClick={handleClick}>
  <Icon name='shoppingBag' />
  Buy Now 
</SecondaryButton>
```
```notes
Your needs may vary, but reducing the number of custom props 
that any component requires is generally helpful, 
and reducing the amount of logic in the render function 
can make the code base simpler and better-suited for code splitting.
```

---
## 6. Use Composition
Don‚Äôt reinvent `props.children`. If you‚Äôve defined props that take arbitrary
 strings of text that aren‚Äôt based on a data structure, 
 it‚Äôs probably better to use composition.

---

```jsx
// Instead of this
<Header
  title='Hello'
  subhead='This is a header'
  text='And it has arbitrary props'
/>

// Do this
<Header>
  <Heading>Hello</Heading>
  <Subhead>This is a header</Subhead>
  <Text>And it uses composition</Text>
</Header>
```

---
## 7. Avoid Boolean Props for enums
They bring about confusion when dealing with variants

---

```jsx
// instead of 
<Button primary />
<Button secondary />

// think about what happens if a user does this
<Button primary secondary/>

// this is better
<Button variant="primary" />
```

---
## 8. Keep props APIs parallel
Reuse props from other components i.e if you‚Äôre creating a custom text input, 
use the same props as the native 

```<input type='text' />``` expects
---
## 9. Ask Your Team Mates
 If these don't fit in your use case then :-
  - Try talking to your teammates
  - Create RFCs, issues and PRs
  - Try [Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html).

<!-- Presentation and Container Slides Begin here -->

---

## Presentation and Container Components
*Also known as Fat & Skinny, Smart & Dumb, Stateful & Pure, Screens & Components e.t.c*

---

|Presentation | Container|
-------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------
Concerned with how things look                    | Concerned with how things work
No dependencies on rest of application e.g stores | Call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational components.
Allow containment via `this.props.children`       | Provide data and behaviour to Presentation
Rarely have their own state or some have UI state | Stateful as they tend to serve as data sources
Are functional components unless they need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations | Usually generated by HOC e.g connect from React Redux

---
## Benefits
- Better separation of concerns i.e data fetching and rendering
- Better reusability. Presentational components can be used in different places
- Self documenting i.e Presentation components define the data they expect

---
```jsx
//  Intstead of
 class CommentList extends React.Component {
  this.state = { comments: [] };

  componentDidMount() {
    fetchSomeComments(comments =>
      this.setState({ comments: comments }));
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <ul>
        {this.state.comments.map(c => (
          <li>{c.body}‚Äî{c.author}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    );
  }
}
```

---
```jsx
// Do this
class CommentListContainer extends React.Component {
  state = { comments: [] };
  componentDidMount() {
    fetchSomeComments(comments =>
      this.setState({ comments: comments }));
  }
  render() {
    return <CommentList comments={this.state.comments} />;
  }
}

const CommentList = props =>
  <ul>
    {props.comments.map(c => (
      <li>{c.body}‚Äî{c.author}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
```






<!-- Higher Order Components Slides BEgin Here -->
---
## Higher Order Components

A HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

A HOC transforms a component into another component.

```js
const TransformedComponent = higherOrderComponent(Component)
```

---
## Commonly Used HOC signatures
- Single Argument HOCs
```js
const NavbarWithRouter = withRouter(Navbar);
```
- Multiple arguments HOCs
```
const CommentWithRelay = Relay.createContainer(Comment, config);
```
---
- Higher-order function that returns a higher-order component
```js
// React Redux's `connect`
const ConnectedComment = connect(commentSelector, commentActions)(CommentList);
// Apollo's graphql
const ConnectedComment = graphql(commentQueryDetails)(CommentList)
```
---

[Demo](http://localhost:3000/)

---
#### Note: Don't mutate original component. Use Composition

```jsx
// Instead of
function logPropsOnUpdate(InputComponent) {
  InputComponent.prototype.componentDidUpdate = function(prevProps) {
    console.log('Current props: ', this.props);
    console.log('Previous props: ', prevProps);
  };

  return InputComponent;
}

// EnhancedComponent will log whenever props are received
const EnhancedComponent = logPropsOnUpdate(InputComponent);
```

---
```jsx
// Do
function logPropsOnUpdate(InputComponent) {
    return class extends React.Component{
        componentDidUpdate = function(prevProps) {
            console.log('Current props: ', this.props);
            console.log('Previous props: ', prevProps);
        };
        render(){
            return <InputComponent {...this.props} />
        }
    }
}

// EnhancedComponent will log whenever props are received
const EnhancedComponent = logPropsOnUpdate(InputComponent);
```

---
### Conventions Used When Implementing HOCs

1. Pass through props to the Wrapped component

---

2. Wrap Display name for easy debugging

```jsx
function withData(InputComponent) {
    class WithData  extends React.Component{/**/}

    const inputComponentName = InputComponent.displayName || InputComponent.name || 'Component'

    WithData.displayName = `WithData(${inputComponentName})`

    return WithData
}
```

---
### Caveats
- Dont Use HOCS inside render methods
```jsx
render() {
  const { query, variables } = this.props
  // A new CommentList object will be created every time the render method is called
  const CommentList = graphql({query, variables})(MyComponent);
  // That causes the entire subtree to unmount/remount each time!
  return <CommentList />;
}
```

<!--Render Props Slides begin here -->
# Render Props
A render prop is a function prop that a component uses to know what to render.

This enables sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.

It helps in sharing the state or behavior that one component encapsulates to other components that need that same state.

---

[Demo](http://localhost:3000/)

---
## Advantages
- No naming collisions
- Can be implemented using both ES6 classes and functions
- Normal React - Its `jsxy`

---
## Caveats

- [A render prop can negate the advantage that comes from using React.PureComponent](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html#be-careful-when-using-render-props-with-reactpurecomponent)

```notes
If you create the function inside a render method the shallow prop comparison will always return false for new props,
and each render in this case will generate a new value for the render prop.
```

## Solutions
- Make the render prop an instance method to store it by reference

<!-- Provider Pattern Slides Begin Here -->
---

# Provider Pattern

Easily Implemented With React's New Context API

It solves the problem of prop drilling

---

### Usage
Create Provider, Consumer pair

```jsx
const { Provider, Consumer } = React.createContext(defaultValue);
```
Use provider to provide some value
```jsx
<Provider value={/* some value */}>
    {children}
</Provider>
```
---

Consume value using a Consumer
```jsx
<Consumer>
  {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
</Consumer>
```

---
Demo + Real World Usage

---
# Caveats

- Unnecessary rerenders when a providers parent rerenders. 
> Can be solved by putting context on state or an instance method


<!-- Compound Components Demo -->
---

# Compound Components

- Used to expose a minimal api surface area to a user

Often used when you have several components that need to access state that a user doesn't need to know about


---

<!-- Beyond Render Props Demo begins here -->
---

## [Beyond Render Props](https://codesandbox.io/s/pj3vx52qoj)
### Inversion of Control
- **Prop Collections:**
Can be used with render props to pass props that are common to all elements that will be rendered by the render prop

---

- **Prop Getters:**
 Do other actions after predefined methods in your component

 - **State Initilizers:**
 Break Encapsulation:  by Giving you component users a way to initialize their state

---

 - **State Reducers:**
 Give Users a way to modify how your component state is managed

- **Control Props:**
 Control how components behave by passing in control props to elements.
 The props are controlled by the parent element

 ```notes
  The terms ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù and ‚Äúuncontrolled‚Äù usually refer to form inputs, but they can also describe where any component‚Äôs data lives.
  Data passed in as props can be thought of as controlled
  (because the parent component controls that data).
  Data that exists only in internal state can be thought of as uncontrolled
  (because the parent can‚Äôt directly change it).
 ```

## Error Boundaries
 JavaScript error in a part of the UI shouldn‚Äôt break the whole app. 

Error boundaries do 
 - catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, 
 - log those errors
 - display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. 

---

Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them.
Error boundaries do not catch errors for:
 - Event handlers (learn more)
 - Asynchronous code (e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks)
 - Server side rendering
 - Errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children)

Note: Event handling doesn‚Äôt happen during rendering. Hence catch errors in event handlers using try/catch
