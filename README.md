# React Tips And Patterns

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/dennisja/react-tips-and-patterns.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/dennisja/react-tips-and-patterns)

Hey Welcome to React Tips And Patterns Repo.
This code was written for workshop I gave at work to talk about cool tips and patterns for writing React Applications
The workshop was inspired by [Kent C Dodd's](https://github.com/kentcdodds) talk at [React Rally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiJ8tRRH0f8)

> Code written in this repository was intended to demonstrate how you can implement those patterns.
> However you should make some optimization for your use cases. Its just good to get you started.
> Code has no tests, Because I had very little time to prepare for this as I was busy being on boarded on to a project and participating in some challenge and I might not have time to add tests due to other commitments, but fill free to.

**The slides of the talk can be found [here](https://dennisja.github.io/react-tips-and-patterns/#0)**
